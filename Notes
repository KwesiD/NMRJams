Personal notes on configuring eclipse:

Import joelib2 library. 
Import all libraries from lib folder
Change compliance levels to 1.5? 
Import JDK 1.8.0_66 (or whichever one is needeD) 
If JRE System Library 1.5? is present in the build path, delete it. This helped manage the "cannot find main" error.
wsi.ra.tenglets package was deleted after doing the above (as it gave problems and was generally useless)
